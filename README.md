# Todo List
 
This todo list is a basic CRUD web application with a Flask backend. It uses SQLAlchemy and 
SQLite for database interaction. Future plans for this list include a weather forecast via 
javaScript API fetching. It's my goal that this application can be viewd first thing in the 
morning and provide users with with a complete summary of all information they may need in the
morning.
